### Description

This button was created to be an enhanced replacement for Visual Basic's standard command button by adding 2 more Border appearance schemes, 2 more button styles, hover effects, 5 more caption styles, and state button compatibility. I cannot guarantee that this code is bug free although I have made every attempt to make it such. If you have any problems with this code please contact me and I'll do what I can to help you though the problem.
